                Milk products and fruits, whole grain breads and cereals, table sugar, starchy vegetables,
                and legumes. Carbohydrates are called "simple" or "complex," depending on how fast your body digests 
                and absorbs the sugar. You get simple carbohydrates from fruits, milk products, and table sugar.
                Complex carbohydrates include whole grain breads and cereals, starchy vegetables, and legumes. 
                Complex carbohydrates and some simple carbohydrates provide vitamins, minerals, and fiber.

                It depends. You need vitamin D for strong, healthy bones and to help prevent osteoporosis. 
                Researchers are also studying vitamin D to see if it affects your risk of getting diseases such as 
                diabetes and cancer, but they still don’t fully understand all of its effects in the body. Most children and adults
                should get 15 micrograms (mcg) or 600 International Units (IU) a day, while those age 70 and older need 
                20 mcg or 800 IU. Good sources of vitamin D include fatty fish, such as salmon and tuna, 
                and fortified milk.

            <div class="Question_Answer">
                As with all vitamins and minerals, it’s important to get enough magnesium for good health. 
                Muscle cramps are one of the signs of a magnesium deficiency, so if you are not getting enough magnesium, 
                getting more might help. But in most cases, muscle cramps are caused by other things.

                A healthy eating pattern is one that provides enough of each essential nutrient from 
                nutrient-dense foods, contains a variety of foods from all of the basic food groups, 
                and focuses on balancing calories consumed with calories expended to help you achieve 
                and sustain a healthy weight. This eating pattern limits intake of solid fats, sugar, 
                salt (sodium) and alcohol.

                of colon cancer. By comparison, the best statin drugs can reduce heart attacks by about 20 or 30 percent.

    <button class="collapsible">Is the BMI a fair measure?</button>
    <div class="QuestionCard">
            <div class="QCimg" style="background-image: url(img/FaqBMI.jpg);">
            </div>
            <div class="Question_Answer">
                The BMI gives a pretty accurate measure of body fat, but the scale has limits. It's really only 
                applicable to "ordinary" people 20 to 65 years of age. The BMI is not an appropriate measure for 
                children, for the elderly, for pregnant and nursing women, or for heavily muscled athletes. 
                For the rest of us, however, it does give a snapshot of how fat we are.

    <div class="QuestionCard">
            <div class="QCimg" style="background-image: url(img/FaqExercise.jpg); background-position: left;">
            </div>
            <div class="Question_Answer">
                According to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), a body mass index, or BMI, of 25 or higher is an 
                indication that your weight may be unhealthy. We all need some body fat, but if stored fat is excessive it may increase
                 risk of diet-related diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. This is particularly true if 
                excess fat is in the abdominal area. Proper diet and exercise would help us reduce stored body fat.

            <div class="QCimg" style="background-image: url(img/FaqBMI_Limitation.jpg); background-size: contain;">
            </div>
            <div class="Question_Answer">
                The BMI does not make a distinction between fat and muscle. A person with a lot of muscle (such as an athlete) may 
                have a BMI in the unhealthy range, but still be healthy and have little risk of developing diabetes or having a 
                heart attack. BMI also may not accurately reflect body fatness in people who are under 5 feet and in older 
                people, who tend to lose muscle mass as they age.

    <button class="collapsible">Does using microwave oven cause cancer?</button>
    <div class="QuestionCard">
            <div class="QCimg" style="background-image: url(img/FaqMicrowave.jpg);">
            </div>
            <div class="Question_Answer">
                Microwaves are not known to cause cancer. Microwave ovens use microwave radiation to heat food, 
                but this does not mean that they make food radioactive. Microwaves heat food by causing water molecules to 
                vibrate and, as a result, food is heated. This is different from absorption of heat energy by food which is 
                the basis of conventional cooking.

            </div>
            <div class="Question_Answer">
                Today's nonstick and Teflon cookware is completely safe for normal home cooking, as long as 
                temperatures do not exceed 570°F (300°C). So you can use your nonstick cookware on the stovetop 
                at low-to-medium heat, but don't use it at maximum heat, or for hotter cooking methods like broiling.

    <button class="collapsible">Can we use Hindalium utensils for cooking?</button>
    <div class="QuestionCard">
            <div class="QCimg" style="background-image: url(img/FaqHindalium.jpg);">
            </div>
            <div class="Question_Answer">
                Hindalium is the alloy of aluminium, magnesium, manganese, chromium and silicon etc.
                Cooking in Hindalium or Indolium kadai orally does not let the food be harmful, but recommend to 
                transfer the food in Steal or Brass container after cooking. When such vessels are used for 5 years or more, 
                the harmful effects start becoming visible. The best alternative is to use Earthen vessels, but when they are 
                not available, vessels made of copper and brass applied with a thin layer of tin should be used.
