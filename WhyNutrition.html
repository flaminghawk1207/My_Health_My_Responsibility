                A dictionary meaning of Health indicates “a state of being free from illness”. Often the challenge 
                is to keep in that state for longer period of time. Many of the comorbidities are acquired through 
                lifestyle, type of work/work environment, and other environmental exposure. It is important to 
                identify these factors that could adversely impact the person’s health to keep in this state 
                for long run.

                Nutrition is the process of providing or obtaining food for necessary for health and growth. 
                Nutritional plans are sustainable, flexible and for varied reasons, not necessary just for weight 
                loss or gain, and primarily for overall nourishment. Nutrition also focuses on how people can use dietary 
                choices to reduce the risk of disease, what happens if a person has too much or too little of a nutrient, 
                and how allergies work.

                Food or drink that we consume on a regular basis is considered as Diet. Diet is part of 
                Nutrition, which is a specific kind and amount of food are recommended for a medical condition
                or specific reason for e.g. weight loss. Diet plans are normally short term, fixed 
                (non-flexible), and difficult to adhere to.

                    &nbsp Often people are conscious of nutrition and diet reactively in response to an event.<br><br> 
                    Imagine you own a car, how do you want to maintain your car? You maintain it very well, right fuel, 
                    right level of coolant always, right tire pressure. What happens if you don’t have right level 
                    of coolant / tire pressure, the car won’t stop then and there, but affects the life of the engine 
                    or tires.<br><br> 
                    A body is a complex god given gift. We don’t realize the worth of the part, until we are dependent 
                    on external intervention. You breathe oxygen day in and day out, imagine a day to be on external 
                    oxygen. Money we spent in hospitalization, cost of oxygen/equipment on an ongoing basis… for a 
                    lifetime! Certainly we owe a lot the creation.<br><br>   
                    For a car, where we have an option to sell or buy a new one, we give so much of importance 
                    to KNOW-IT-ALL about the car,  maintain it well, and focus to upkeep of performance, 
                    proactive / periodic monitoring of working condition.<br><br> 
                    How much time do we have to take care of our own health? How much we know about our body,
                    needs, what we feed, impact in short term and long term?<br><br>

                    Do we have these excuses while maintaining our car? Are these real excuses? Are these worth

                    There are several resources across internet, and contradicting recommendations, uninterrupted 
                    endorsements from celebrities, and it is challenging to to decide what is right and to take it 
                    forward.<br><br> 
                    It is normally recommended to rely on evidence/research based on recommendations rather than 
                    simply relying on what is get through hearsay or on google.<br><br>
                    There are several researches done in these lines, and recommendations are made based on 
                    observations and analysis. This is always helpful to verify if there is any research associated 
                    with this.<br><br>
